        Andrea Schwartz Boone has hired literally <em>thousands</em> of people and she's sharing her top nine tips.<span class="media-duration">3:17</span>
        <div class="transcript">
          <p>Hi! I’m Andrea Schwartz Boone, and I’m the Executive Director of Braven here in the Bay Area, and I’m super pumped to talk to you about the hiring process from your perspective. I’ve hired lots of people, like in the thousands, so here’s my advice:</p>
          <p>Number one: Make sure your LinkedIn profile is up to date, that you have a professional photo, that your experiences are in there, and that you have a great summary, because ultimately, that’s the first thing people are going to do when they see your name come across, is actually look you up on LinkedIn to get a sense for who you are and what you stand for professionally.</p>
          <p>Number two: You’re going to have to prepare your application materials. That’s typically a resume and a cover letter. You do need to tailor these for each role, and that means that based on the job you’re applying for, make sure to highlight using the bullets, the accomplishments or the work that you did that most relate to that job.</p> 
          <p>Number three: You actually want to see if you can get a referral. You’re much more likely to get hired if you know someone who knows someone who works at this company. You might not have a referral and that’s totally fine. But if you do, you can either ask them to hop on the phone before you submit and give you advice or maybe write a quick note for them that they can send over to the contact they know at the company, so that the company knows to look out for your application. </p>
          <p>Number four: Submit! Submit your resume and your cover letter. </p>
          <p>Number five: The company will actually do an initial screen. They will just look at your resume and cover letter and they’re typically looking for three things: Number one, does this person have any applicable experience? Number two, do they have evidence of results in their previous roles? And number three, in the cover letter, are there spelling or grammar mistakes? They’ll also do a keyword search where they’ll see if your experience is actually applicable to the job at hand. </p>
          <p>Number six: If that works out, you’re going to go to the phone screen. This is typically not with the hiring manager, so it’s typically with a recruiter or not the person who would actually manage you in the job. Here, they just want to get to know your story. They want to dig into your relevant experiences, get a sense of what you accomplished, what your working style is. They like to understand, what you be like to work on a team with? And they’ll also check for your communication ability.</p>
          <p>Number seven: Typically, if this works out, you’re invited to do some exercises, which is actually completing a little project that simulates what you might be doing in the job. This often lets hiring managers get a sense of how would this person really complete this. That’s not always the case, but it’s often time included. </p>
          <p>Number eight: After the exercises, this is when we do final interviews, which is typically with the hiring manager, who your boss would be, who your boss’s boss would be. It’s a deeper dive into is this person a strong fit within this role? Can they do the job well, but also within this organization? Are they a great team member? Will they fit in with the culture here? </p>
          <p>Number nine: If that works out, step nine is a reference check. They’ll call up the references you gave and typically they’re just looking for, can this reference confirm the strengths we think we see? And number two, are there any flags we didn’t know about? And if the references check out, which they should - do not actually give references that will say concerning things about you &mdash; you’ll get the offer! Woohoo! </p>
          <p>So those are my ten steps. Would love to chat with you more if you have any questions: andrea@bebraven.org. Good luck!</p>

      <p>As you can see, the majority of people chose not to apply because they didn’t meet the qualifications. But when hiring managers create a job description, it is more of a wishlist than a list of requirements, meaning they’re not expecting they’ll find a candidate who meets every single qualification they list. Take it from this career coach:</p>
      TBD IMAGE
      <blockquote>“The requirements listed in job descriptions are guidelines, not hard and fast rules. You don’t have to satisfy every requirement or meet every qualification listed. If your skills are transferable and you are in the ballpark with the number of years of experience the company’s looking for, apply. Applying gives you the opportunity to be considered.” <p class="quote-source">Avery Blank</p></blockquote>

    Quick question
    So, who has the strongest resume of the bunch? 
    Louis
    Eric
    Amanda

    That’s right, based on Amanda’s resume, she’s the most likely to receive an invitation to interview. 
    Quick Question
    Jerrod is writing bullet points in his resume under his experience of serving as the Online Sports Editor for his college newspaper. Which of these bullets is the strongest?
    Increased the online views of sports news articles by 50% 
    Yes! He uses an action verb and shows the quantifiable outcome of his efforts (50%). Sounds impressive!  
    Was the Online Sports Editor for two years 
    He doesn’t start with an action verb. Also, he can include the dates of his involvement above where he begins writing bullets of his accomplishments. 
    Reading articles that sports contributors send me 
    Instead of “Reading,” he should use the present or past tense “Read.” He shouldn’t use the first person, “me,” and this bullet could be stronger if he included a quantitative achievement such as “Read and edited ten contributors’ articles a week.” 
      Coordinated the publication of the online sports section 
    This point could be more specific so we really understand his achievements: Who did he coordinate? Did he manage anyone? How often did he do this?
