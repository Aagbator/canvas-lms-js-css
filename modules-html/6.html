    <p>You find a job posting you're excited about on LinkedIn. You apply online, submitting your resume and cover letter. What are the chances you will be selected for an in-person interview?</p>

    <p>It's just 3%, and yes, that might sound like a depressing statistic. The good news is that there are tried and true steps you can follow to increase your chances of being in that 3%.

        Andrea Schwartz-Boone has hired literally <em>thousands</em> of people and she's sharing her top nine tips.<span class="media-duration">3:17</span>
        <div class="transcript">
          <p>Hi! I’m Andrea Schwartz Boone, and I’m the Executive Director of Braven here in the Bay Area, and I’m super pumped to talk to you about the hiring process from your perspective. I’ve hired lots of people, like in the thousands, so here’s my advice:</p>
          <p>Number one: Make sure your LinkedIn profile is up to date, that you have a professional photo, that your experiences are in there, and that you have a great summary, because ultimately, that’s the first thing people are going to do when they see your name come across, is actually look you up on LinkedIn to get a sense for who you are and what you stand for professionally.</p>
          <p>Number two: You’re going to have to prepare your application materials. That’s typically a resume and a cover letter. You do need to tailor these for each role, and that means that based on the job you’re applying for, make sure to highlight using the bullets, the accomplishments or the work that you did that most relate to that job.</p> 
          <p>Number three: You actually want to see if you can get a referral. You’re much more likely to get hired if you know someone who knows someone who works at this company. You might not have a referral and that’s totally fine. But if you do, you can either ask them to hop on the phone before you submit and give you advice or maybe write a quick note for them that they can send over to the contact they know at the company, so that the company knows to look out for your application. </p>
          <p>Number four: Submit! Submit your resume and your cover letter. </p>
          <p>Number five: The company will actually do an initial screen. They will just look at your resume and cover letter and they’re typically looking for three things: Number one, does this person have any applicable experience? Number two, do they have evidence of results in their previous roles? And number three, in the cover letter, are there spelling or grammar mistakes? They’ll also do a keyword search where they’ll see if your experience is actually applicable to the job at hand. </p>
          <p>Number six: If that works out, you’re going to go to the phone screen. This is typically not with the hiring manager, so it’s typically with a recruiter or not the person who would actually manage you in the job. Here, they just want to get to know your story. They want to dig into your relevant experiences, get a sense of what you accomplished, what your working style is. They like to understand, what you be like to work on a team with? And they’ll also check for your communication ability.</p>
          <p>Number seven: Typically, if this works out, you’re invited to do some exercises, which is actually completing a little project that simulates what you might be doing in the job. This often lets hiring managers get a sense of how would this person really complete this. That’s not always the case, but it’s often time included. </p>
          <p>Number eight: After the exercises, this is when we do final interviews, which is typically with the hiring manager, who your boss would be, who your boss’s boss would be. It’s a deeper dive into is this person a strong fit within this role? Can they do the job well, but also within this organization? Are they a great team member? Will they fit in with the culture here? </p>
          <p>Number nine: If that works out, step nine is a reference check. They’ll call up the references you gave and typically they’re just looking for, can this reference confirm the strengths we think we see? And number two, are there any flags we didn’t know about? And if the references check out, which they should - do not actually give references that will say concerning things about you &mdash; you’ll get the offer! Woohoo! </p>
          <p>So those are my ten steps. Would love to chat with you more if you have any questions: andrea@bebraven.org. Good luck!</p>

    <p>As you can see, the majority of people chose not to apply because they didn’t meet the qualifications. But when hiring managers create a job description, it is more of a wishlist than a list of requirements, meaning they’re not expecting they’ll find a candidate who meets every single qualification they list. Take it from this career coach:</p>

    <blockquote>“The requirements listed in job descriptions are guidelines, not hard and fast rules. You don’t have to satisfy every requirement or meet every qualification listed. If your skills are transferable and you are in the ballpark with the number of years of experience the company’s looking for, apply. Applying gives you the opportunity to be considered.” <p class="quote-source">Avery Blank</p></blockquote>

      <figcaption>Carlos, a former Braven Fellow, explains here how revising his resume helped him secure a career-accelerating summer internship<span class="media-duration">2 minutes</span>
        <div class="transcript">
          <p>Hello everyone, my name is Carlos. I am a Braven alum interning at Dropbox. So in this video, I’m going to talk about how important it is to get your resume revised.</p>
          <p>So a little background about my resume. Before Braven, I thought I had a very good resume. I thought my resume was concise. I thought it clearly explained my skills, and it gave the hiring manager or recruiter a good idea of who I was. But I came to find out once I met my Braven Leadership Coach that my resume was not as good as I thought it was. She explained to me how important it is to have your resume revised constantly. It was a very slow and tedious, but a very rewarding process. My resume got revised 6-10 times.</p>
          <p>The thing about a resume is that it can never be totally perfect, but there are clear steps to take in order to have a resume that is concise and clear and it allows you to put the best foot forward. Because let’s be honest: every time we apply to something we always want to get an email back with good news regarding a phone screening or an on-site interview. It allows us to move along in the process. The first step is to have a good resume. It was very hard for me to understand that. But my leadership coach allowed me to get a clear understanding that not every resume is going to be interpreted the same way, but there are steps you can take in order to get a resume that will get understood the way you want it to consistently. That’s the thing about a resume: it needs to be consistently understood by everyone, whether it’s a manger or a recruiter.</p>

  <h3>HOW TO MASTER THE ART OF THE COVER LETTER</h3>
  <div class="bz-box question">
    <h4 class="box-title">Quick Question</h4>
    <p>Why does your job application need a cover letter in addition to the resume?</p>
    To tell a story that your resume can’t to convince the hiring manager that you are perfect for the role 
    To inform the hiring manager of who is sending the resume 
    To repeat what you said in your resume 
    To list all the experience that didn’t fit in your resume 
    TBD DONE
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box answer">
    <p>The beauty of a cover letter is that you can craft a compelling story of who you are that the restrictive format of a resume just doesn’t allow.</p>
    <p>You can highlight personality traits, strengths, soft skills (e.g. eagerness to learn new things, ability to work independently), why you’re insanely likeable, why you’re going to fit in, why you’re going to perform incredibly well, and why your experience and skills are relevant to the role you’re applying for.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box question">

  <div class="bz-box action">

    <ol>
      <li>Keep a master resume in one place, like in a Word or Google doc, that includes all of your experience in it. It might be longer than a page, and that’s fine, because <strong>you’ll never send your master resume out</strong> in an application.</li>
      <li>When applying for an opportunity, cut and paste relevant opportunities from the master resume into the version of your resume for that application.</li>
      <li>Likewise, keep your cover letters all in one place and cut and paste relevant sections into the new cover letter you’re working on. Just remember to proofread so that you <strong>don’t end up using the wrong company or person name</strong>!</li>
