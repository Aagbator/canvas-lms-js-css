    <p>Braven is unlike any other course you&rsquo;ve taken in college. In fact, it&rsquo;s more like a job in how you&rsquo;ll interact with your colleagues and what they&rsquo;ll expect of you.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll need to take the time to onboard to Braven to ensure you&rsquo;re successful in your role of Braven Fellow this semester. &nbsp;</p>

    <p>It just so happens that at Braven, we expect the very same things a manager in a job expects of you.</p>
  </div>
  <h4>PROJECTS</h4>
  <p>In the workplace you&rsquo;ll be given projects and deadlines, and then it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out how to manage your time to ensure you meet the deadline. The same is true at Braven.</p>
  <p>Here are the major projects you will complete throughout the semester. They assess your mastery of the skills you will learn at Braven, but they will also look good in your career portfolio and help you land a career-accelerating opportunity.</p>
  <p class="tbd">Please select your location: SJSU SCI75, SJSU SCI125, RU-N, NLU</p>
  <br />
  <p class="tbd">[e.g.]</p>

  <p>There is no <em>secret</em> to success in the Braven Accelerator; we want to be transparent about what you need to do to succeed. That&rsquo;s why each project will have a rubric to guide how you approach and complete the project.</p>
  <p class="tbd">Here&rsquo;s an example of a rubric row from the first project, Design Your Career. Hover over each part of it to learn more about how to use it.</p>

  <p class="tbd">[When hover over different parts, Fellows will see some of this info: Braven rubrics are organized into rows and columns. The rows list the expectations and the columns describe the different levels of mastery: Meets or Exceeds (10 points), Somewhat Meets (8 points), Developing (6 points), or Does Not Meet (0 points). To get full credit on this rubric row, you want to look at what it will take to meet or exceed the expectation, which means writing a Portrait that includes a discussion of three of your strengths and includes specific examples from your own life for each of those strengths.]</p>

    <p>That&rsquo;s right - it&rsquo;s smart to reference rubrics quite a lot so that you know the expectations and how to meet them.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s also helpful to do so in any job: get clear on what&rsquo;s expected and refer to those expectations as you work.</p>
