    <p>It just so happens that at Braven, we expect the very same things a manager in a job expects of you.</p>
  </div>
  <h4>PROJECTS</h4>
  <p>In the workplace you&rsquo;ll be given projects and deadlines, and then it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out how to manage your time to ensure you meet the deadline. The same is true at Braven.</p>
  <p>Take a look at the syllabus you downloaded earlier for the major projects you will complete throughout the semester. They assess your mastery of the skills you will learn at Braven, but they will also look good in your career portfolio and help you land a career-accelerating opportunity.</p>
  <h4>Grading Rubrics</h4>
  <p>There is no <em>secret</em> to success in the Braven Accelerator; we want to be transparent about what you need to do to succeed. That&rsquo;s why each project will have a rubric to guide how you approach and complete the project.</p>
  <p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a rubric row from the first project, Design Your Career. See the legend below for details.</p>

    <p>That&rsquo;s right - it&rsquo;s smart to reference rubrics quite a lot so that you know the expectations and how to meet them.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s also helpful to do so in any job: get clear on what&rsquo;s expected and refer to those expectations as you work.</p>

Only through my mistakes did I learn how to build a product people want, bring it to market, and fundraise from investors. I am far from ashamed of this failure, as it gave me the best opportunity to grow and learn.&nbsp;</td>
            <td>I guess I had many chances to learn from failure... :) I used to behave as if my&nbsp;boss was my dad. I wasn't aware I was doing it, but looking back it's very clear I was basically acting out my&nbsp;family dramas with him, when I should have been smarter and just worked with him. It took me years of fighting and banging my head against walls to figure that out, and then root it out.&nbsp;</td>
            <td>So many times. ...Earlier in my career, I realized that in order to lead, I needed to let go of definitions of femininity that I internalized from my cultural upbringing, which&nbsp;hindered me from truly affecting change for others. I struggled because I thought if I let&nbsp;those things go, I would be compromising my identity or become "less attractive".&nbsp;That struggle was important in my leadership formation.&nbsp;</td>

Not every job is worth it, and job opportunities are actually like taxis: even if you&nbsp;let one go by, another will arrive shortly. Yes, you might need the money right now, but how much is your mental health or professional skill-building or network-building worth?&nbsp;</td>
