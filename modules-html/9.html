Their sense of self-worth isn't dependent on the solutions they land on. </p></li>
        <li class="correct"><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="dts-q05-3" />Critical thinking skills <p class="feedback inline">Problem-solving draws on critical thinking and your ability to use knowledge, facts, and data to effectively solve problems.

    <p>In addition to solving human-centered problems, Design Thinking is a great approach for tackling complex, persistent problems that are difficult to frame because it asks us to spend more time listening to users and defining the problem than building solutions. We stay away from “jumping to conclusions” too quickly because if we don’t adequately understand the problem, we might build an unnecessary solution that doesn’t work or that no one uses.</p>

      <h5 class="box-title">Answer</h5>
      <p>Empathy is the foundation of the human-centered design process.</p>
      <p>You need to understand the people whose problems you're trying to solve (typically defined as "<i>users</i>" of a product, service, or system), in order to build a solution they can use. And you must build empathy for who they are and what’s important to them. Effective Design Thinking takes you, your ideas, your tastes, and your assumptions out of this important first step and puts the user at the center of your curiosity and innovation.</p>

For example saying "Tony needs a low-cholesterol food option" will make us focus on questions such as what type of sandwich Tony should choose at Popeye's, but might block out ideas such as increasing exercise, taking cholesterol-reducing drugs, changing Tony's diet, or a mix of the above.</p>

      <h6>SURPRISING INSIGHT</h6>
      <p>This describes what you've learned about the user and his/her need.</p>
      <p>Insights combine observation with intuition. It should be surprising, not trivial. And it should not the same as the need ("Tony needs to reduce his cholesterol because he has high cholesterol" doesn't help us much). If the insight is not surprising, seek something bigger or more challenging to help inspire innovative solutions. In the example about Tony, the insight is that he could die if he doesn't change his eating habits &mdash; his high cholesterol could lead to a heart attack.</p>
