    <h4 class="box-title">Answer</h4>
    <p>According to a recent BCG survey<a class="ref-source" href="https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/human_resources_leadership_decoding_global_talent/?chapter=5#chapter5">#</a> these are the top five factors that made Americans most satisfied at work:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Working for a financially stable company</li>
      <li>Having a good relationship with your manager</li>
      <li>Good work-life balance</li>
      <li>Good fit between company values and personal values</li>
      <li>Being appreciated for your work</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <p>Looking at the survey results above, you'll notice that people who are happiest at work have jobs that align with their needs and with what they're good at; in other words, they are living their <em>hustle</em>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your hustle is the result of your heart &ndash; your values, passions, interests &ndash; and head &ndash; your strengths and talents, what you know &ndash; working in line with each other. You know that feeling when you are in the zone, losing track of time? If you can find work (for enough money) that makes you feel this way, that's your hustle.</p>
  <h2 id="why">Why does this matter?</h2>
  <div class="bz-box question">
    <h3 class="box-title">Quick Question</h3>
    <p>What percentage of Americans would you guess feel engaged at work?</p>

    <h3 class="box-title">Answer</h3>
    <p>According to a Gallop survey<a class="ref-source" href="#">#</a>, only 30% of Americans are engaged at work. That means most Americans are either indifferent or unhappy with what they are doing with the majority of their time. But does it have to be this way?</p>

        <span class="credit cc sa">Photo by Kyle Pearce (Flickr)</span></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Create a vision board representing your interests and passions (not just professional/academic). You can do this digitally by using a service like Pinterest, a slide deck etc. Or you can do it the traditional way, by cutting and pasting clippings from magazines or your own artwork, if you prefer.</p>
    <p class="tip">It doesn't have to be very pretty, so don't go overboard making it perfect! Ten minutes should be more than enough to make a basic board.</p>
    <p>When you're done, paste a link to your vision board (or to a high quality image of it) here:</p>

  <h3>How to identify your strengths <small>(your head)</small></h3>
  <p>Now that you've explored your heart, it's time to uncover what's in your head - your unique strengths and skills.</p>
  <div class="bz-box action">
    <h4 class="box-title">Get to Know Yourself</h4>
    <p>There are many ways to uncover your strengths. For example, as part of your <a href="https://portal.bebraven.org/courses/27/assignments/650" target="_blank">Design Your Career project</a> you'll be asking people who know you for stories that highlight your strengths. Another option is to take personality tests (such as <a href="https://www.strengthstest.com/" target="_blank">Strengths Finder</a> or <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/" target="_blank">Myers Briggs</a>, which are also popular with recruiters).</p>
    <p>One of the most comprehensive tests is the <a href="http://www.viacharacter.org/" target="_blank">VIA Character Strengths Assessment</a>. Take the test now (requires registration, and takes about 20 minutes) and when you're done, paste your top five strengths in here:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <input type="text" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="text" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="text" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="text" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="text" />
      </li>
    </ol>
    <input type="button" class="bz-toggle-all-next" value="Done" />
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box reflection">
    <h5 class="box-title">Reflect</h5>
    <p>Did any of the strengths surprise you? If so, which ones?</p>
    <textarea></textarea>
    <p>What are some times that you exemplified these strengths?</p>
    <textarea></textarea>
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box question">
    <h4 class="box-title">Quick Question</h4>
    <p>You may have noticed that most of the strengths in the VIA test focus on interpersonal relations and character traits, as opposed to skills, knowledge, or specific talents. Why are those important to your career choice?</p>
    <ul id="via-reasons" class="checklist" data-bz-max-score="3">
      <li class="correct">
        <input type="checkbox" value="1" />
        Employers sometimes use these tests to sort through job candidates, and it's useful to know what they'll be seeing about me</li>
      <li class="correct">
        <input type="checkbox" value="1" />
        It always helps to know yourself</li>
      <li class="correct">
        <input type="checkbox" value="1" />
        Some careers or jobs have more room to apply certain strengths than others, and knowing what those are can help me find a good fit.</li>
    </ul>
    <input class="for-checklist bz-toggle-all-next" type="button" value="Done" />
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box answer">
    <h4 class="box-title">Answer</h4>
    <p>All of the above are correct. When you encounter similar tests in the future it's usually helpful to try them out (but also keep in mind they're not all scientific, so take the results with a grain of salt).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box action">
    <h4 class="box-title">Get to Know Yourself Even Further</h4>
    <p>Braven has partnered with experts and employers to create the following list of critical skills for securing career accelerating opportunities.</p>

    <p>At the end of the semester, you will have the chance to assess yourself on these skills again and see how far you have come and where you still have room to grow.</p>

  <h3>How to Define Your Hustle</h3>
  <p>You'll be doing more work to define your hustle during this week's Learning Lab. The following should give you a great head start:</p>
  <div class="bz-box question">
    <h4 class="box-title">Quick Question</h4>
    <p>Imagine you can magically create any job at any organization to fit you perfectly. With your values, interests, and strengths in mind, create up to three wanted ads for such perfect fit jobs:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <textarea></textarea>
      </li>
      <li>
        <textarea></textarea>
      </li>
      <li>
        <textarea></textarea>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box action">
    <h4 class="box-title">Back to the Real World</h4>
    <p>Take a few minutes to search job sites using your strengths and values as search keywords (<a href="https://portal.bebraven.org/courses/27/pages/recommended-resources-for-your-opportunity-hunt?module_item_id=3757" target="_blank">find a list of job search sites here</a>).</p>
    <p>List any jobs you find that align with your hustle here:</p>
    <p><textarea></textarea></p>
    <p>What came up?</p>
    <ul class="instant-feedback checklist dont-mix">
      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" />
        <q>Nothing that would interest me.</q>
        <p class="feedback inline">Don't fret. The jobs you're looking for might be using different terms to describe what they're looking for, or might be advertising in other places. And at least you have a sense of what you don't want, which narrows down the search.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" />
        <q>Some surprising things I wasn't even thinking about.</q>
        <p class="feedback inline">Great! Take note of these surprising jobs and explore them further. You may be onto something.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" />
        <q>Lots of jobs that would interest me.</q>
        <p class="feedback inline">That's great! You're way ahead of the game.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other:</p>
    <textarea class="checklist-other"></textarea>
    <p><input class="bz-toggle-all-next" type="button" value="Done" />
		</p>
  </div>
  <h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
  <div>
  <p>A career that is aligned with your head (what you're good at) and your heart (what you love to do) is likelier to make you happy and successful. Remember the following equation:</p>
  <p class="match-heading-style">HEAD + HEART = HUSTLE</p>
  <p>In Learning Lab this week, you'll dig deeper into your head and heart in order to explore career paths aligned with your hustle.
</p>
  <p>As always, if there are any loose ends feel free to run through the module again, talk to other Fellows on BravenHelp, talk to your cohort mates or Leadership Coach, or simply ask us directly: <a href="mailto:support@bebraven.org" target="_blank">support@bebraven.org</a>.</p>
  <p>See you at the next Learning Lab!</p>
