  Former Braven Fellow Kamerie shares why and how she prepares for an interview.<span class="media-duration">1:15</span>
  <div class="transcript">
    <p>Before going to my interview, I made sure that I’ve done a bit of research beforehand on the company or organization I am trying to intern for. I also make sure to jot down a few questions I plan to ask the interviewer beforehand. Some of those questions include: What does a typical day in this organization look like for you? And why do you enjoy working here? </p>
    <p>What I stress to dedicate more time to is preparing for the most common questions the interviewers may ask you. And those questions include: What do you know about our organization or company? Why do you want this job? Why should we hire you? And why are you different than the other people we are talking to? By already having answers to the questions they are going to ask you, employers can learn that you are serious, dedicated, and willing to go above and beyond the bare minimum if given the opportunity to be an intern for their company. </p>
    <p>Secondly, I make sure to prepare for the interview mentally. That way I can avoid my mind going blank if I’m too nervous. Preparation for me looks like, thinking of examples, experiences, awards and responsibilities I can mention in my interview that I did not have space for or to elaborate on in my resume. All in all, my goal is to avoid regurgitating what is already in my resume, but to instead give life to that piece of paper.</p>

    Quick question:
    Which of these questions are the most commonly asked in interviews? Select the top two questions asked. 
    Tell me about yourself. 
    Why this job? 

    Tell me about a time you failed. 
    What are your greatest strengths? 
    What are your salary requirements?
    Tell me about a time you exemplified leadership. 
    Why are you leaving your current job?

    DONE
  </div>
  <div>
    ANSWER
    <p>While "Tell me about yourself" and "Why this job?" are the top two questions, they are actually asking the same thing! At first glance, you might think, well no, those are two distinct questions. One is about me and one is about the job. Read Karen’s story to help explain why these questions, asked in an interview, are asking the same thing.</p> 
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box read">
    Story Time
    Karen shook the hand of her interviewer and sat down at the table. 
    “It’s great to meet you!” said Karen. 
    “It’s great to meet you too,” said the interviewer. “Now why don’t you tell me a little bit about yourself.”
    Karen paused, trying to hide her confusion. What did the interviewer want to know? There were so many things about herself she could tell…
    “Well, sure!” Karen began. “I’m originally from Los Angeles. I have two brothers and a sister. My father died when I was little, so I barely remember him. I moved here for college, and while I planned to move back to LA after college, I recently decided to stay so I could move in with my boyfriend. So I’m now looking for opportunities in this area that will help me grow professionally.”
    The interviewer furrowed her forehead, took some notes, and then said, “Let’s move on to the next question, shall we?”
   
  </div>
  <div>
    Quick Question
    Why was Karen’s answer to this question not very good? (check all that apply)

    The information she provides about herself is irrelevant to the job she is applying for. 
    It’s not focused.
    It gives the impression that she might prioritize relocation with her boyfriend over her job. 
    She says she’s looking for opportunities to grow professionally, but this is vague. What about this specific job?

    Her answer is too long.
    She’s not enthusiastic enough. 
    She’s not being polite. 
    She needs to provide more detail on her early childhood. 

    DONE

  </div>
  <div>
    ANSWER
    Karen made the rookie mistake of answering the question “Tell me about yourself” with an unfocused story about her personal life. Interviewers love to ask this question at the beginning of interviews to see if you’re able to focus when responding to such an unstructured question. 

    The secret to success is to respond like you would respond to the question, “Why this job?” You want to explain why you’re a good fit for this role at this company.
  </div>
  <div>
    Quick Question
    Here are three candidates’ responses to the question, “Tell me about yourself.” Select the best one. 
    Ever since I was a child and experienced my mother battling cancer, I’ve been fascinated by the pharmaceutical industry, specifically oncological drugs. I’ve spent my college career studying biomedical engineering to learn more about the processes that go into creating medications. I interned last summer at a pharmaceutical company, BioFirst, where I helped conduct clinical trials on a new cancer treatment. I also serve as the Vice President of our school’s Biomedical Engineering Club, planning events and workshops of interest to our members. 
      
    Throughout these experiences, I’ve learned that my real strength is my attention to detail. I’m able to stay organized and juggle multiple tasks at the same time, ensuring everything I commit to gets done on time. 

    I’m interested in this position at your company because of your laser-like focus on cancer treatments and your nimble team, which can move efficiently and effectively. I’d be excited to put my skills to use helping to effectively manage your new clinical trials. 

    I’m a really good listener and problem-solver. Whenever I say I will get something done, I do it efficiently and effectively. You can ask my professors and former employers: I have never been late on an assignment or a task. And I take pride in that! 

    I’m hoping to put these skills into good use at your company. I can help take your team from good to great! There’s nothing I love more than putting my strengths to good use. 
    What company is this candidate interviewing with? His answer is unspecific and doesn’t answer the question, Why this job? It’s also not flattering that he started off by listing all of his praises before explaining his passion for this kind of work. 

    I feel like I grew up in and out of hotels since my parents’ jobs were always cleaning rooms. I remember thinking how glamorous the hotel lobby felt and loved the hospitable atmosphere that the hotel employees created for their guests. The hotel felt like home to me; it felt safe. 

    These experiences growing up are why I’m now pursuing a career in hospitality. I hope to manage a hotel one day so that I can create the same kind of feeling of ‘home’ for guests when they are away from their actual homes. 
    While this candidate explains why she is interested in the hospitality industry, she doesn’t explain why this job in particular (it’s not clear which role she is applying for), and she doesn’t explain her relevant experience, strengths, or abilities.

    You ask your friend what her greatest strengths are. Which answer would most convince you that her greatest strengths are managing teams and staying calm under pressure? 
    “Last summer, I worked at a clothing store. One morning I came into work and realized that something had gone terribly wrong with the closing shift the night before because the store hadn’t been cleaned up at all. I looked at my watch and it was only a half hour before the store opened. My colleagues began panicking and getting angry at the employees who closed the night before. I quickly realized we didn’t have time to figure out what had happened, but instead, we needed to get to work cleaning up the store. I began delegating tasks, asking one colleague to re-rack clothing, one to sweep the floors, and another to refold shirts in the front of the store. I also got to work organizing clothes in the back of the store. With our combined efforts, we were able to open the store on time with only a few tasks left for the first hour of the store being open, which happened to be our slowest time anyway. When my manager learned about how I had managed the team and stayed calm under pressure in a sticky situation, she promoted me to be a floor manager. 
    My greatest strengths are managing teams and staying calm under pressure.

    Answering questions with stories is more compelling, memorable, and believable. Your responses to interview questions are really just stories, at the end of the day. 
    There are two storytelling frameworks you can use when answering interview questions. The point of using a framework is to keep your stories focused. The last thing you want to do is ramble on and never get to the point. 
    The first framework is called SYRCL (pronounced circle). Use this framework to answer behavioral questions,which aim to learn how you operate, learn, and deal with adversity. Some examples of these questions might be:
    What is a recent accomplishment you are proud of and why? 
    When have you worked with a team and failed?
    How would you work with a teammate who isn't producing great work? How do you motivate someone who doesn't have the skills, ability, or motivations that you have?
    What would people say about your leadership style?

    Quick Question
    Here’s an example of a candidate’s SYRCL response to the question, “How would you work with a teammate who isn’t producing great work?” Read the response and then identify the situation, the student’s role, the result, the challenges, and what the student learned. 
    Last semester, I worked on a group project in my anthropology class where I was paired with two other classmates, and we were required to choose a neighborhood, conduct fieldwork, and present an ethnography to the class. At the beginning of the project, our team split up the work evenly. However, my teammate who was in charge of creating the presentation slides waited until the last minute to complete his part, and the presentation left much to be desired in terms of professionalism. I knew our grade depended on this presentation, but I also didn't want to discount my teammate's work or redo the entire presentation. So I asked him if we could meet, and we worked together, slide by slide, to improve the presentation.
    Because of our work, we ended up delivering an excellent presentation and received an A on the project. It was definitely a challenge to ensure my teammate felt valued when we were improving the presentation, but I tried to be empathetic and present it as a learning experience for both of us, and I think he appreciated that. I realized that I believe in the power of teamwork and that my authentic leadership shines as a patient, empathetic team player.

    That’s right - an interview is a two-way street. You might say something that sparks an idea or memory for the interviewer, and you will have time to ask questions too. The best interviewers feel like a seamless conversation.
    At the end of the interview, your interviewer will undoubtedly ask, “Do you have any questions?” However, they're not really asking...interviewers expect you to have questions, and they are often evaluating the quality of these questions to see if you did your research. You’ll need to come to the interview prepared with some excellent questions.

    Sort these questions into good questions to ask the end of the interview and bad questions.

    What is the most important advice you give to new hires?
    What is your favorite part of working at X company? 
    When and how should I follow up after this interview?

    How do you feel about the President's position on...
    How do you think your company is doing based on the recent big change in its stock price?

      <li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="h2cb-resume-pulse03" />It was unhelpful. My resume is already perfect.<p class="feedback instant">Doubtful! Even experts need help on their resumes. Put your resume in front of your LC and see if there’s anything s/he suggests to change. </p></li>
      <li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="h2cb-resume-pulse04" />I didn’t attend Learning Lab so I didn’t receive feedback.<p class="feedback instant">Such a loss! Make sure to use your time wisely in the next two Learning Labs to get the feedback you need to improve it.</p></li>

    <ul>
      <li>Discussed why you can’t excel at interviewing unless you know what’s expected of you and prepare</li>
      <li>Looked at some research tools you could use and how each of them might help you</li>
      <li>Practiced answering the top question(s) in most interviews: Tell me about yourself/Why this job?</li>
      <li>Drafted a couple of answers to other common questions using two useful frameworks for telling a compelling story (<span class="bz-has-tooltip" title="Situation, Your role, Results, Challenges, Learnings">SYRCL</span> and <span class="bz-has-tooltip" title="Problem, Actions, Results">PAR</span>)</li>
      <li>Practiced coming up with some good questions to ask back</li>
      <li>And finally we optimized your application documents (resume and cover letter) a bit more, to get you in the habit of constantly tweaking them to fit different opportunities</li>
