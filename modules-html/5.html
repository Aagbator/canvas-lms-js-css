          <div class="transcript">
            <h6>Pauline</h6>
            <p>Hey guys! My name is Pauline and I was in Braven as a Spring &lsquo;14 Fellow, and I could definitely say that networking played a major role as to where I&rsquo;m at today. </p>
            <br>
            <p>When I graduated this past semester, Braven hooked it up with a bunch of informational interviews and networking opportunities where I got to talk with people from companies like Pandora Radio Station, a bunch of startups, and some nonprofit organizations, things I was interested in. I got to talk with these employees, kind of get a feel as to what their jobs were like and if I was interested in it. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Networking is definitely for me an exciting, thrilling, but also very nerve-y feeling. You just got to do what you got to do, put yourself out there and be yourself because that&rsquo;s the best self. Cheesy but true! Again like I said, I would not be where I am today without networking. Lesley - you probably have met her - she tagged me in a LinkedIn post with a job position for Google, and because she tagged me in it, the person who posted it reach out to me, and now I am at Google as a Staffing Services Associate Recruiting Coordinator. So, don&rsquo;t forget to network! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <h6>Nhu</h6>
            <p>Hi, my name is Nhu, and I&rsquo;m a Fall 2015 Braven alumna. I&rsquo;m here today to share with you some tips about networking that I learned over the past few years. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Of the four jobs I&rsquo;ve had, three of them I&rsquo;ve had because I knew someone in the organization, or had people introduce me to that person, and after that I realized the power of networking. I highly encourage anyone, especially college students, to get out of your comfort zone and get to meet people, because you never know if one day, they are the one who will be helping you to get closer to your dream job. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <br>
            <p>Although I believed that hard work can get you anywhere, networking helps you get to the place you want to be faster and in a more direct way by introducing you to their professional networks. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Another thing I learned about networking is that it&rsquo;s not about being formal and professional with them all the time. Although you met them at a conference, it&rsquo;s very good to maintain the relationship by getting to know them on a personal level. When you establish a meaningful relationship with someone, they are more likely to help you in the future and remember you when an opportunity comes up. And that is how I got my previous jobs. </p>
            <br>
            <p>That&rsquo;s all I want to say about networking, and I hope you enjoy it! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <br>
            <h6>Jimy</h6>
            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Jimy, and I&rsquo;m a third year student majoring in Management and Information Systems. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I would like to personally thank the Braven community because I wouldn&rsquo;t be where I am today without the help from you guys. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Just a little bit more background about myself. I&rsquo;m currently a legal data science intern at a startup called Lex Machina. I&rsquo;m also a data analyst intern at a semiconductor company called Applied Materials. And last but not least, I&rsquo;m also a database intern at a nonprofit organization called San Jose Downtown Association. &nbsp;</p>
            <br>
            <p>To me, networking definitely did help me get my first internship, which then led to the other two. In the beginning of spring 2017, Bri, who is the Marketing Director at San Jose Downtown Association, who also happened to be a Braven alumna, was invited as a keynote speaker. During that time, she also mentioned something about a database intern, so I decided to just give it a try and see what happened, and here I am today. Without the help from Bri, I feel like I would not have gotten that internship, because -- especially nowadays -- things are very competitive. </p>
            <br>
            <p>My opinion about networking definitely did change, in that I feel more obligated to connect with others, because it can be beneficial for me in the long run. I still keep in touch with my Leadership Coach and my mentor from Braven because the power of networking is super important. </p>
            <br>
            <p>If you guys have any more questions, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:jimy.ry@sjsu.edu">jimy.ry@sjsu.edu</a>. Thank you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <br>
            <h6>Jalil</h6>
            <p>Hey guys! My name is Jalil Ahmad, and I was a Fall 2015 Braven Fellow, and today I&rsquo;d like to tell you a story about how networking actually helped me land an internship at Google. </p>
            <br>
            <p>So, towards the end of the Braven Accelerator Course, I actually applied for the Google internship, and I would later find out that I actually wasn&rsquo;t accepted, but being that it was my junior year and I knew how crucial it was to have an internship, I ended up applying for an internship with Teach for America that I actually found out about through Braven. This internship didn&rsquo;t exactly align with what I wanted to do, but because Braven has such close ties with Teach for America, I decided to kind of leverage that connection and apply for the internship and just make the best of the opportunity. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Fast forward to the summer. I actually ended up getting the internship and really, really enjoying it. So upon my last day of work, my manager asked me and the other intern why we had decided to take the internship. I mentioned to her how I had initially applied for Google, didn&rsquo;t get in, and then learned about the Teach for America internship through Braven. When I mentioned Google, she said, &lsquo;Oh wow, I didn&rsquo;t know you were interested in Google. You should talk to my boyfriend. He&rsquo;s the head of the interns program at Google.&rsquo; She was able to get us connected and this ended up being a crucial component to me getting the internship.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I think from this story, two main lessons come out of it. The first is that networking doesn&rsquo;t have to be something that takes place in an intimidating setting like a job fair or something like that. You can end up getting a really critical connection through a simple conversation. And two, continue networking even when you&rsquo;re in an internship or you&rsquo;re at your job because you never know who other people know. Good luck!</p>

  <p>Networking is how you find a job, but it's something you do all the time, not only when you're looking for a job. And for some jobs it's actually part of the job: sales, fundraising, recruiting, research.</p>

    <ul>
<li><strong>Random contact </strong>&mdash; This happens to you all the time, requires little effort, and can help you a lot if you're lucky. Keep in mind that when you meet someone new you're not growing your network; you just helped them grow theirs!</li>
      <li><strong>Targeted contact</strong> &mdash; When you have a particular goal in mind (find a job, research an industry) you can try a more strategic approach.</li>
		</ul>
    <p>Let's look at some targeted search strategies:</p>
	</div>
  <h4>Go where the people you want to meet usually hang out</h4>
  <h5>Where to find people</h5>
  <p><strong>Lots of people realize networking is important, so they create events for it.</strong></p>
  <p>There are dozens of networking events happening every day in your area. Sometimes they are advertised as networking events; sometimes they are called meetups or panel discussions.</p>
  <p>Ideally, you want to find events that relate to your career interests, as they will attract professionals in your desired field. To help you get started, here is a list of places to find networking events happening in your area:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Your university, its alumni association, and clubs all host networking events throughout the year. If you're unsure of how to find out about these events, stop by your career services office to get more information.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

Search for events using relevant search terms, choose one of their categories like &quot;Business&quot; or &quot;Science &amp; Tech,&quot; or choose the &quot;Networking&quot; event type.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/directory/groups/">LinkedIn Groups</a>: Use LinkedIn Group's &quot;Discover&quot; capability to find relevant and local LinkedIn groups and join them. These groups will post any in-person events they are hosting.</p>

  	<h6 class="box-title">Some ideas that work</h6>
    <p><strong>THE CLASSICS</strong></p>
    <p>They're classics for a reason &mdash; they always work.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><q>Hi, I don't know too many people here, so I wanted to introduce myself. I'm [name] and I work at [company] / study at [school].</q></li>
      <li>Hi, mind if I join you?<q> I'm [name] and I work at [company] / study at [school].</q></li>
      <li><q>So, what do you do?</q></li>
      <li><q>So, what brought you here today?</q></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION</strong></p>
    <p>No matter what, you've got at least a couple things in common with every person in the room: the event you're attending, the place it's being held at, and the food and drink you're consuming. Use that to your advantage!</p>
    <ul>
      <li><q>How did you hear about this event?</q></li>
      <li><q>What a beautiful venue. Have you been here before?</q></li>
      <li><q>So, was it a pain for you to get here?</q></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong>THE NEWSWORTHY</strong></p>
    <p>This is another thing you have in common with just about everyone. Try to avoid veering into politics unless that's your industry.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><q>What do you think about [topic related to the event]?</q></li>
      <li><q>Any chance you read the news today? I missed it, and I'm curious what's going on with [topic].</q></li>
      <li><q>Did you catch the game last night?</q> (only ask this if you can actually talk about sports!)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>GREAT FOR INTROVERTS</strong></p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re an introvert, walking into a room full of unknown people can feel extra intimidating. One of our favorite approaches is to look toward the outskirts of the room and find someone who looks a little lonely. Maybe that person sitting alone doesn&rsquo;t know anyone and is just hoping that someone will come talk to them. Be that person, and try one of these lines.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><q>Man, these networking events can be so crazy. Mind if I join you over here where it&rsquo;s a little quieter? I&rsquo;m [name], by the way.</q></li>
      <li><q>Since we're both here at the [buffet, bar, same table], I feel I should introduce myself. I'm [name].</q></li>
      <li><q>I&rsquo;m feeling pretty overwhelmed by the deluge of info that&rsquo;s being firehosed at us today. Is there one nugget of brilliance that&rsquo;s really resonating with you?</q></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>THE TOTALLY RANDOM</strong></p>
    <p>If all else fails, consider one of these:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><q>Any chance you know a great [sushi /Mexican / burger &hellip; ] place around here?</q></li>
      <li><q>If there is one question you do not want me to ask you, because you are sick and tired of answering it, what question would that be?</q></li>
      <li><q>I'm new to this. How do you usually start a conversation with someone you haven't met before?</q></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box question">
    <h6>Quick Question</h6>
    <p>When you introduce yourself you're likely to experience a surge of adrenaline. That's totally normal, but it also means <strong>you will have a hard time taking in the other person's name</strong>.</p>
    <p>Which of following is <strong>not</strong> a trick used by professionals to remember their conversation partner's name?</p>
    <ul class="radio-list">
      <li class="incorrect"><input type="radio" name="networking-mnemonic" data-bz-retained="networking-mnemonic" value="option1" />Repeat it a few times: "Nice to meet you, Sally" and later "so, Sally, what do you do?" and "it was great to meet you, Sally"</li>

  <div class="bz-box answer">
  	<h6>Answer</h6>
    <p>Remembering someone's name isn't really about memory, but about focusing your attention on that person. Most people can become very good at remembering names with just a bit of practice of techiques like the ones listed above.</p>
  </div>
  	<h6>What to talk about</h6>
  	<p><strong>The other person</strong></p>
    <p>If there's one thing people can always talk about, it's themselves. Make things easy for yourself by asking them questions and then following up with more questions about things you find interesting. Remember you're talking to a human being, so try to be authentic and don't fake interest (it will show). If you feel the conversation isn't flowing very well, consider wrapping it up (see below).</p>
    <strong>Yourself</strong>
    <p>Sometimes the other person will ask you one of the classic questions: "So, What Do You Do? / Tell Me About Yourself / What Brings You Here?" Sometimes you won't be asked, but will still need to communicate quickly who you are and your interests.</p>
    <p>That's the perfect time to launch into your <em>elevator pitch</em>: an extremely short introduction to help the other person know who you are and what you're interested in. It has to be so short that you could effectively present yourself (and/or your project/organization) on a short elevator ride, hence the term Elevator Pitch.</p>

  <div class="bz-box answer">
  	<h6 class="box-title">Answer</h6>
    <p>Stephaine is a very strong pitcher, and does a good job leading the conversation without going too far. What Brandon likely takes away from this is that Stephanie is a person who takes initiative, has energy and focus, and demonstrates good communication skills (she's concise and clear).</p>
    <p>Such traits and skills are highly valued in almost any job, and are hard to fully demonstrate in a resume or job application.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box action">
  	<h6 class="box-title">Take a small but real step</h6>
  	<p>Use the template below to draft a pitch to a potential employer. You'll try it out during Learning Lab and keep improving it through the Accelerator and beyond.</p>
		<p><strong>1. THE OPENING</strong></p>
    <p>Start with a greeting and a great handshake.</p>
    <blockquote>
    	<p>Hello, my name is&nbsp;<input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-name" />&nbsp;and I am a student at&nbsp;<input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-college" />&nbsp;majoring in <input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-major" />.</p>
		</blockquote>
    <p><strong>2. WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO</strong></p>
		<p>It's best to tell this as a story with a cause and effect. For example you can tell them how your classes led you to realize you have a passion for a particular subject or skill. Don&rsquo;t go into too much detail, but be sure to demonstrate your deep interest or passion for your intended career field. Employers want to know you care about what you do.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I'm interested pursuing a career in <input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-career" />. In school I've <input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-experience" />, which has taught me a lot about&nbsp;<input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-learned" />.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>3. WHAT THEY SHOULD CARE</strong></p>
    <p>Make a list of skills and strengths you&rsquo;ve developed from previous experiences and think about how they relate to what you want to do. Then, pick the most relevant ones to work into your elevator pitch. Even if you&rsquo;ve only had jobs or internships in an unrelated field, think about your duties and accomplishments and find ways to relate them to what you want to do. For example serious sports experience can exemplify your ability to commit and persist, work in teams, and handle pressure.</p>
    <blockquote>
			<p>This past summer I <input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-interned" placeholder="interened at... participated in... worked on... " />, which was a great experience. I learned <input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-skill" />, which I believe will be really valuable in the future.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><strong>4. THE&nbsp;ASK</strong></p>
    <p>State your future intentions (internship/job related), and why you think the company (or industry) is a good fit for you. Include a specific ask, such as specific questions about this profession. At the very least ask if you can email some follow-up questions. If you&rsquo;re talking about a specific job, don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask if you can send your resume for the role. If you&rsquo;re not discussing a specific job, ask for an informational interview about that field or organization.</p>
<blockquote>I intend to go into <input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-go-into" /> when I graduate in two years,</blockquote>
<p><strong>AND/OR:</strong></p>
<blockquote>I intend to pursue an internship in <input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-pursue" />&nbsp;for next summer.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;Now get to your ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could we speak for 15 minutes over the phone regarding <input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-topics" />? What are some times that work for you?</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>5. CLOSE</h4>
<p>Whether it's a thank you or a next step, make sure you wrap your pitch up so it doesn't end abruptly.&nbsp;Make sure to close out your pitch by expressing your passion and interest in the person you&rsquo;re talking to and their field.</p>
<p>Now, you might dress up the language or add in some information you feel is&nbsp;important, but this is a basic starter kit for your first pitch. Download the elevator pitch template <a id="" class=" instructure_file_link" title="SPRING 2017.Elevator Pitch Template.docx" href="/courses/25/files/9790/download?wrap=1" target="" data-api-endpoint="https://portal.bebraven.org/api/v1/courses/25/files/9790" data-api-returntype="File">here</a> and get started crafting your own elevator pitch!</p>
